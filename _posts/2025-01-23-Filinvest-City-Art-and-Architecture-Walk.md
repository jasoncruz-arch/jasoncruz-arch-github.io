 Recently, I've been rediscovering a lot of what Filinvest City in Alabang has to offer. As a southie, the main focal point of the area for me had always been Festival Mall or Westgate, which are primarily indoor commercial spaces, along with the couple of corporate office buildings scattered around the area. I’ve been based in the United Arab Emirates for the past four years, and ever since coming back for the holidays I noticed a quiet yet increasing number of new installations and public spaces that have a surprising amount of detail and care brought to them. I think that over the past few years after the pandemic, we’ve gained a deeper appreciation for nature and third places– environments away from home and work that encourage social interactions, physical activity, and spaces for reflection. I created this guide to highlight these hidden gems, which are surprisingly accessible and interconnected within a 2 km walk. Along the way, you get to walk along the Alabang Creek and throughout the district’s different parks. I hope this guide is able to highlight and celebrate these places, and that we to continue to advocate and see more spaces like this in Manila and around the Philippines.
