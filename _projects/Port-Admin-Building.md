For the New York University Abu Dhabi 2024 Civil Engineering capstone project, we were tasked to design a sustainable seaport that serves as a key trade hub for Abu Dhabi. The admin building would serve as a landmark feature, providing office spaces for the logistics of the port.

This project was shortlisted as an outstanding thesis in the Anthology 2024 End of Year Thesis Competition, hosted by WTA Architecture + Design Studio.
