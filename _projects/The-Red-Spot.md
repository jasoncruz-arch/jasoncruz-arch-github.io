The Red Spot is a dynamic intervention piece that makes use of metal structures on the highline park of New York University Abu Dhabi. Fabric pieces were designed to create volume, maximize shade, and interact with the wind. The installation is able to provide shading to revive the outdoor space on campus. A prototype was funded, created, and proposed to NYU Abu Dhabi’s administration.

    <p> The fabric addition to these shade structures consists of 14 parabolic shapes of various widths, but with the same height. This streamlines the fabrication process while conforming to the shape of the structures. </p>
    <p>
    Each parabolic piece was fabricated by hand out of jersey fabric. This was done by creating templates for each of the 14 pieces with A3 sized paper. Chalk was then used to trace the shape, and then fabric shears were used to cut them out. The top of the fabric was folded several times and then punched with a hole puncher, where zip ties will be used to install them onto the existing shade structure. Afterwards, each individual piece was installed at alternating intervals. </p>
