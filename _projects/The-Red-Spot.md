The Red Spot is a dynamic intervention piece that makes use of metal structures on the highline park of New York University Abu Dhabi. Fabric pieces were designed to create volume, maximize shade, and interact with the wind. The installation is able to provide shading to revive the outdoor space on campus. A prototype was funded, created, and proposed to NYU Abu Dhabiâ€™s administration.
