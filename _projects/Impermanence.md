Impermanence is an iconic, fully sustainable pop-up structure that is designed to completely disappear after it is used. In order to achieve this goal, it uses only ready-made and recyclable materials: reused scaffolding, and “living” canvas that will receive a second life by being transformed into tote bags, wallets, and other merchandise. The structure encourages participation from the visitor by allowing people to take a piece of the pavilion home with them. The pavilion was designed and built over the span of 5 months, with a total budget of 41,000 USD.

## Pavilion Programming
<br><br>

A sustainable temporary pavilion is one that truly disappears after it is used. Three main concepts drive the programming of the pavilion, responding to Abu Dhabi Art’s theme of sustainability:
<br>

 <div class="content-row">
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Reform </h3>
    <p>
     Construction scaffolding, painted an eye-catching red, was rented and used for the pavilion. It is an already readily available material in the UAE that would be returned to regular use after the exhibit. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Repurpose </h3>
    <p>
     The facade of the pavilion is turned into a “Living Canvas” that visitors can draw and interact with. Afterwards it was transformed into tote bags, wallets, and other Abu Dhabi Art memorabilia that visitors were able to take home with them. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Reuse </h3>
    <p>
     All other elements of the pavilion, such as furniture, would specifically be rented and not bought for the event. This reduces unnecessary purchasing and waste, allowing them to be reused again after. </p>
