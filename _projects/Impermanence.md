Impermanence is an iconic, fully sustainable pop-up structure that is designed to completely disappear after it is used. In order to achieve this goal, it uses only ready-made and recyclable materials: reused scaffolding, and “living” canvas that will receive a second life by being transformed into tote bags, wallets, and other merchandise. The structure encourages participation from the visitor by allowing people to take a piece of the pavilion home with them. The pavilion was designed and built over the span of 5 months, with a total budget of 41,000 USD.
