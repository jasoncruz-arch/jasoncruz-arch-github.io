Impermanence is an iconic, fully sustainable pop-up structure that is designed to completely disappear after it is used. In order to achieve this goal, it uses only ready-made and recyclable materials: reused scaffolding, and “living” canvas that will receive a second life by being transformed into tote bags, wallets, and other merchandise. The structure encourages participation from the visitor by allowing people to take a piece of the pavilion home with them. The pavilion was designed and built over the span of 5 months, with a total budget of 41,000 USD.

## Pavilion Programming
<br><br>

A sustainable temporary pavilion is one that truly disappears after it is used. Three main concepts drive the programming of the pavilion, responding to Abu Dhabi Art’s theme of sustainability:
<br>

 <div class="content-row">
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Reform </h3>
    <p>
     Construction scaffolding, painted an eye-catching red, was rented and used for the pavilion. It is an already readily available material in the UAE that would be returned to regular use after the exhibit. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Repurpose </h3>
    <p>
     The facade of the pavilion is turned into a “Living Canvas” that visitors can draw and interact with. Afterwards it was transformed into tote bags, wallets, and other Abu Dhabi Art memorabilia that visitors were able to take home with them. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-col" style="flex: 1 1 0;">
    <br> <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Reuse </h3>
    <p>
     All other elements of the pavilion, such as furniture, would specifically be rented and not bought for the event. This reduces unnecessary purchasing and waste, allowing them to be reused again after. </p>
  </div>

    <p> These renders were presented to the jury of the competition. The gateway entrance serves as the highlight of the pavilion, welcoming visitors to the first Abu Dhabi Art since the beginning of the pandemic. During the construction phase, it was estimated that the projector would go overbudget, so it was unfortunately cancelled from the original plans. </p>

    <p> In these photos the construction of the pavilion can be seen, beginning in October 2021 for a completion date of November 2021. We worked with the contractors to ensure that the plans for materials were properly followed to ensure the sustainability of the pavilion. </p>

    <h3>About the Abu Dhabi Art Pavilion Prize</h3>
    <p>
     The Abu Dhabi Art Pavilion Prize was launched in 2017, inviting university students from across the United Arab Emirates to develop architectural proposals for a Pavilion. Each year the winning design is realised at the Abu Dhabi Art fair and seen by thousands of visitors. It is conceived as a temporary structure that remains during the week of the art fair at Manarat Al Saadiyat, with the potential to be repurposed or relocated. </p>
