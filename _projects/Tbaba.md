Tbaba (تبابة) is a pavilion showcased at Dubai Design Week 2024 in Dubai Design District (d3). This innovative installation merges Filipino and Emirati maritime heritage through a wind-responsive design that transforms traditional pearl diving elements into contemporary architectural expression and creating an engaging space that provides shade and sparks cultural dialogue. Tbaba challenges conventional notions of design in the UAE through the power of intercultural collaboration and the potential of simple, sustainable materials to create high-impact, meaningful spaces.
