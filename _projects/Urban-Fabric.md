Urban Fabric, the prestigious Christo and Jeanne-Claude Award 2022 Winner, is a public art installation in Abu Dhabi, UAE. This innovative project features a series of three sculptures that resemble pieces of thread, seamlessly intertwined with the urban landscape of the Emirates' capital. The sculptural forms are interlaced into the ground, transforming the physical environment of Abu Dhabi into a vast canvas, with the city itself becoming part of the artwork.

Commissioned by the Abu Dhabi Music and Arts Foundation, Urban Fabric stands as a testament to the emirate's commitment to contemporary art in public spaces and is on permanent display at Rabdan Marina. Urban Fabric was built over the span of eight months with a total budget of 10,000 USD. All photos taken, renders, and diagrams of the project are own work. <br> <br>

    <p>
      Urban Fabric is designed as a site specific environmental art piece in the spirit of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s work– a sculpture that interacts with its surroundings and is accessible to all. Since the winning sculpture is exhibited around Abu Dhabi, Urban Fabric becomes a frame of reference between different locations. It is an archive of a time and place. At a larger scale, these sculptures are scattered throughout the city, made possible by the decentralized nature of its design.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite being in different locations, these sculptures are linked through the fabric that is the city. </p>

## Installation and Placement

    <br>
    <p> Planning the placement of each sculpture, depending on the location, was an important aspect in the curation and logistical process.</p>
    <p> At Manarat Al Saadiyat, the sculptures served as a gateway that welcomed people into the area.</p>
    <p> At NYU Abu Dhabi, Urban Fabric’s placement intersected and interconnected with paths that foster community connections.</p>
    <p> At Umm Al Emarat, the artwork followed the existing path of the park. This guided people to the nearby sites.</p>
    <p> Location 4, Rabdan Marina, is the final home of Urban Fabric. The site overlooks the landmark Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, as well as Zaha Hadid’s Sheikh Zayed Bridge, permanently becoming a part of Abu Dhabi's built environment.</p>
