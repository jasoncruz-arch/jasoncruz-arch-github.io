Urban Fabric, the prestigious Christo and Jeanne-Claude Award 2022 Winner, is a public art installation in Abu Dhabi, UAE. This innovative project features a series of three sculptures that resemble pieces of thread, seamlessly intertwined with the urban landscape of the Emirates' capital. The sculptural forms are interlaced into the ground, transforming the physical environment of Abu Dhabi into a vast canvas, with the city itself becoming part of the artwork.

Commissioned by the Abu Dhabi Music and Arts Foundation, Urban Fabric stands as a testament to the emirate's commitment to contemporary art in public spaces and is on permanent display at Rabdan Marina. Urban Fabric was built over the span of eight months with a total budget of 10,000 USD.
All photos taken, renders, and diagrams of the project are own work.
