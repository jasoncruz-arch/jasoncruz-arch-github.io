Sitting on a currently derelict piece of land next to the mangroves and fish ponds of the Mithi River, the project aims to convert this space into a multipurpose community area used for fishing, recreation, and hosting various festivals throughout the year. The site serves as a thresholdbetween Dharavi Koliwada, an indigenous fishing village in Mumbai, with reconnecting it with the river, and subsequently its past. As part of the Engineers for Social Impact class, we travelled to Mumbai for one week to develop the proposal and present it to the Koli Jamat Trust and Dharavi Fishermenâ€™s Association, two key stakeholders who welcomed the project.
